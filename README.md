## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  - Vite.js is a development tool that comes with a dev server and is used for modern web applications.
  - It offers a faster and smoother workflow in terms of development.

### What I learned

- Tried to create a input box for credit card entering feature. How hard that can be if you know _`regex`_ (honestly it took some minutes with _`regex`_) but with normal JS to create that feature you have to put way more logic than you thought. Yes there so many _`react provided library`_ also there to help you out for solving the issue.
- Using _`‚Äúmin‚Äù`_ _`‚Äúmax‚Äù`_ in Input box in html.
- Use the _`onFocus`_ and _`onBlur`_ events in React to handle focus and blur events on elements.
- Also learned that these events are equivalent to the native _`focusin`_ and _`focusout`_ events, but they are normalized to bubble in React.
- A _`ternary operator`_ inside the style prop of an element to conditionally apply inline styles.
- Learned that an _`empty object in the style prop means no inline styles are applied to the element`_.
- How to style the _`placeholder text in an input box using CSS`_.
- Learned that I can use the `::placeholder` pseudo-element selector to apply different styles to the placeholder text than the input text.
- Also learned how to create a floating label effect for my input box, where the placeholder text moves above the input field on focus.
- How to use an input box followed by a label element, and use the `adjacent element selector (+)` to style the label based on the input state.
- Responsiveness design.
